Henri Rousseau (21 May 1844 Ð 2 September 1910) was a French post-impressionist painter in the Na•ve or Primitive manner. He was also known as Le Douanier (the customs officer), a humorous description of his occupation as a toll and tax collector.[1] He started painting seriously in his early forties; by age 49, he retired from his job to work on his art full-time.
