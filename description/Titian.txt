Tiziano Vecelli or Vecellio (1488 â€“ 27 August 1576), known in English as Titian, was an Italian painter of the Renaissance, considered the most important member of the 16th-century Venetian school. He was born in Pieve di Cadore, near Belluno. During his lifetime he was often called da Cadore, 'from Cadore', taken from his native region.
