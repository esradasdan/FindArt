William Ralph Turner was born in Chorlton-on-Medlock, Manchester in 1920. A largely self taught painter and teacher, he has become known as one of the last authentic Northern English industrial artists. Lowry was to visit Turner's exhibitions at the Tib Lane gallery in the 1950s and 1960s, and the influence of L.S. Lowry can be seen in Turner's work.
